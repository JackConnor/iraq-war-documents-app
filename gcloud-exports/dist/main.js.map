During this time, USSOF observed SAF and RPG fire at two AH-64 Apaches that 1were circling approx. 2 kms to the NE. After approx. 30 minutes on the ground USSOF 1and SWAT began a Movement To Contact IVO the area identified by ODAh-4a| with the 1understanding that all CF had left the area and the majority of AIF were killed earlier by 1USSOF and ISF. 1PHASE 3: (EXECUTION): 1Movement to Contact: 18Z cross-loaded 12 x SWAT onto the 5-ton before infilling 1directly east on the hardball road leading to a set of chicken coups at MGRS 38S MA 138。54좌 Order of March was two SWAT trucks in the lead, the HMMWV, four SWAT 1trucks, the 5-ton, then the remaining SWAT trucks. The JTAC established comms with 1the Apaches as the ground force left ASR Miami. The ground force approached the 1chicken coup from the south and moved the HMMWV to the lead to enter the perimeter 1fence. SWAT and the HMMWV drove the inside perimeter to clear the area, giving 1visibility of the north side where an approx, six foot high berm 300 meters away ran east- 1west and another berm approx. 500 meters away ran north-south, boxing the area in to 1the north and east. The area between the chicken coup and the berm was open flat 1terrain with no cover. The lead HMMWV led the ground force east towards a break in 1the berm attempting to get out of a potential Engagement Area (EA). On approach the 1HMMWV gunner saw a suspicious lone HMMWV move so니th to north on a hardball road 1approx. 500 meters east, then multiple armed LNs, vehicles, and HMMWVs on the 1opposite side of the berm in defensive fighting positions. The break in the berm was 1actually a cliff manned by more armed LNs. I 」3 b 6 I realizing the potential to 1become quickly overwhelmed but not having enemy PID, fired the .50 cal into the berm 1to keep their heads down. The LNs held fire and hurriedly pointed to the north. 1Realizing that the gro니nd force was boxed-in if AIF occupied and fired from the opposite 1side of the berm, the 18A directed the ground force to occupy the berm on the north and 1east of the chicken coup. ((USSOF later learned that the AOB, witnessing this unfold 1through an ISR feed, saw approx. 100 AIF on the opposite side of the berm.)) 1React to Ambush (MGRS 380a Q： Simultaneously, but unbeknownst to the lead 1HMMWV, AIF dismounts on the opposite side of the north berm (approx. 100 m to the 1north) began to engage the ground force with SAF. The 18Z in the 5-ton yelled for the 1ground force to flank west towards the north berm. USSOF in the 5-ton saw the column 1of SWAT trucks and HMMWVs oriented west to east, all left turn in unison and move 1north online to the berm.

This placed the HMMWV with half of SWAT to the east, and 1half of SWAT and the 5-ton to the west. The AIF displaced north from the berm and 1occupied hasty fighting positions along the tree line approx. 50 - 75 m north of the berm 1and continued to engage the ground force. At this point the ground force effectively 1became split in half with the 5-ton and SWAT on the west pinned down by effective fire 1and the HMMWV and SWAT less than 100 m to the east under minimal fire and able to 1maneuver and return fire from the berm. Every time USSOF or SWAT on the west 1raised a head above the berm, incoming rounds sent dirt flying. SWAT received one 1WIA during this time and ground evacuated him to an Iraqi hospital. The JTAC 1requested the Apaches, who were focused on the gunfire in the village, move to the 1ground force location to conduct RW g니n nuns on the AIF fighting positions. The 5-ton 1gunner was the only individual on the west flank able to continually provide effective 1suppressive fire. The eastern flank identified a white Bongo and a blue Bongo with a 1heavy MG mounted in the bed, approx. 200 - 300 meters to the north behind another 1berm, to which the AIF were maneuvering. I b 3. b 6 lenaaaed the blue Bongo with 1four 81 mm Carl G니stav (Carl G) rounds (2 x HE, 2 x HEDP), killing one and impacting 1the blue Bongo, while the HMMWV gunner engaged multiple dismounted targets. The 118A engaged multiple targets before directing SWAT to occupy the eastern berm and 1rear security to prevent an AIF flanking mane 니 ver. The 18A and I b 3, b 6 Ithen 1examined the eastern flank of the AIF and noticed a north-south running berm that 1potentially provided cover for a dismounted force to flank the AIF. At this point, approx, 1five minutes into the react to ambush, the JTAC reported that an Apache was shot down 1to the NW at MGRS 36|i冨53园(just east of ASR Miami) by ground fire. The second 1Apache then focused on the downed Apace. Additional reports came in confirming that 1there were, in fact, three IA 니MMWVs IVO a village to the NW that were st이en by the 1AIF. Not realizing the severity of the western flank's situation, the 18A directed a break 1in contact to move to the downed aircraft. The 18Z informed the 18A that this was not 1feasible due to the heavy volume of fire they were receiving, and recommended a 1flanking maneuver. The 18A acknowledged and instructed the SWAT CDR to assemble 1men for a dismounted assault with the 18A, JTAC, andl b 3 b 6 I The 18Z then 1recommended that the flanking element only establish a base of fire as opposed to 1assaulting west, do to limited ability to shift SWAT's fires in support of a moving element. 1I b 3, b EI wisely recommended the HMMWV with gunner and driver move to support 1the western flank, where it assisted the 5-ton gunner in providing continual suppressive 1fire for the western flank. The 18A requested additional support from the AOB to secure 1the crash site. The 18A, incorrectly understanding from the JTAC that the two remaining 1fast-movers could be split between the 18Z and the 18A, req니ested that it happen to 1ensure both elements could receive CAS. Only later did it become apparent that the 1message was not understood due to multiple aircraft talking in the JTAC's ears at the 1time. Meanwhile on the western flank, the 18Z, I b 3 b 6 I 1(曲⑶,(b)(知ade repeated unsuccessful attempts to get SWAT to gain fire superiority from 1the berm. These USSOF continually gave commands and led by example, rising above 1the berm to engage the enemy and lead SWAT in establishing fire s니periority. Except 1for one brief period they were simply unwilling to remain above the berm to return fire. 1USSOF noticed that most of the AIF were wearing black tops and bottoms with assault 1vests and magazine racks.

The SWAT medic 1conducted follow-on checks with I b 3, b 6 I later in the day. After treating two gunshot 1wounds to the head.l b3 b6 I engaged dismounts in the open with the 81 mm Carl 1G HE round set for air burst at approx. 200 m. I b 3 b 6~1 realized the impact on SWAT 1if a USSOF Soldier was removed from the fight and fought to avoid collapse on several 1occasions. His efforts lik이y averted a complete collapse of SWAT's will to fight on the 1west flank. On the east Hank.l b6 Icontinuad assembling approx. 50 SWAT for 1the dismounted assault. I b 3 b 6 learried an AT-4 he took from the HMMWV before 1it joined the base of fire team on the west. 1Company Attack: There was now a flanking element consisting of 50 SWAT dismounts 1led by I b 6 lalona with the 18A, JT AC, I b 3, b 6 I and interpreter 1I b 6 I and a base of fire element led by the 18Z and remaining USSOF and SWAT 1in이tiding two SWAT Company CDRs. The 18乙 with two USSOF injured and hims이f 1controlling the base of fire, directedl b 3 b 6 I to focus on the truck FM and SATCOM 1to maintain comms with the flanking element and the AOB, ensuring crucial comms 1during the maneuver.丨 b 3 b 6 Icontinued providing crew-served fire 1support whilel b 3 b 6 Icontinued motivating SWAT to 1return fire. The flanking element moved south around the eastern berm then back north, 1passing numerous ISF hunkered down in the low ground and stopped at another east- 1west running berm j니st forward of earlier one. At this point the flanking element noticed 1a road running east-west just in front of the berm, on which were multiple IP and civilian 1SUVs that were riddled with SAF. The road on the east running north-south was across 1approx. 50 m of open ground and the intersection had several other destroyed vehicles. 1This position provided better visibility of the eastern flank to which the element was 1maneuvering. Again,I h 3 h 6 land the 18A assessed the feasibility of moving north. 1AIF to the NW, seeing movement through the break in the berm, began firing on the 1flanking element, decreasing the rate of fire on the base of fire element. The 18Z was 1now able to get the base of fire to provide suppressive fire. By this time a second flight 1of Apaches was on station providing gun runs on AIF fighting positions IVO the two 1Bongo trucks. Using the base of fire and gun runs to suppress the AIF, the flanking 1element crossed the road and moved north along the berm approx. 100 m before being 1pinned down by SAF from the north. The JTAC identified the friendly position with a 1signal mirror and requested a GBU-12 approx. 100 meters to the north on the two Bongo 1trucks. The 18A told the flanking element to assault the enemy position as soon as the 1bomb landed. After impact the flanking element assaulted the enemy position, climbing 1an approx, eight foot berm to see down into the corner of a 10 foot deep trench line that 1ran west as far as the eye could see and north approx. 50 m until another berm blocked 1the view. On the opposite side another berm approx. 20 feet high from the bottom of the 1trench 이ccked all but the barrel of the Bongo mounted heavy MG. USSOF and SWAT, 1still receiving fire, engaged the survivors in the trench. I （b）⑹ Iwhile leading SWAT to 1the top of the berm and engaging the enemy, received a gunshot wound to the face 1requiring I b 3 b 6 Ito assess and pack the wound with Kerlix. This severely 1diss니aded SWAT from continuing to fire from the top of the berm. This was the first 1realization by the ground force of the magnitude of AIF defensive preparations. During 1this time the JTAC witnessed one AIF blow himself 니p approx. 150 m away in the trench. 1SEGREW/REE TO USA/ AUS” GAN 7 G曲〃；2。3 2 g 3。 1 De이assified by: MG Micha이 X.

Realizing that the CAS allocation hadn't worked as planned, 1the 18A and JTAC began working to get them a CAS mission. The aircraft, unable to 1directly communicate with the 18Z, requested a grid as opposed to a distance and 1direction from the VS-17 panel marking the 5-ton at their position. After relaying the 1TGT grid, aircraft stated it was the friendly position of the VS-17 panel and requested a 1distance and direction from the VS-17 panel then delayed again to confirm that the 18Z 1had eyes on the TGT. USSOF confirmed that the original TGT grid was correct, but 1numerous grids passed in a short period of time created confusion for the pilots. At this 1time the confusion of numerous aircraft requiring air control assistance forced the JTAC 1to assume air traffic controller duties to arrange the aircraft. While this new development 1set in, HMMWVs approached from the north along the road, firing mini-g니ns and .50 cal 1into the berm just north of the flanking element. It was unclear at first whether they were 1frien에y or the st이en HMMWVs. B이ieving they were f「ien에y but fearing fratricide, the 118A moved to a position in the open and began waving both arms at the HMMWVs, 1which then pulled into position next to the dismounts to coordinate. The 18A identified 1himself as the Ground Force CDR (GFC) and coordinated efforts with three separate 1individuals (USN Seals and members of| i,4a pFG(A)) who identified themselves as TF 1| 14a | with the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Force (ICTF) The18A sketched the L-shaped 1configuration the ground force was currently in for TFl 1.4a ISA.

The flanking element, realizing the futility 1of further advances in light of the situation, began moving back south to re-link up with 1the base of fire and use CAS along with the new understanding of the battlefield to 1destroy remaining enemy positions. Meanwhile, the base of fire element began talking 1with the ODAFT47I18A on SATCOM at the time of the GBU-12. The 18Z ensured that 1the ODAl 1.4a |18A would h이d TF I 1.4a Ifrom their assault until ODA h.4a| cleared their 1assault lane. Soon after that, the base of fire element received significant fire from a 1mini-gun and .50 cals to the north. TF | 1.4a at this time had turned onto a westward 1running road and presumably began firing south to cover their movement. The base of 1fire element, believing that TFl i.4a I assault south was underway, called for a cease- 1fire on SATCOM and FM to prevent fratricide. The 18Z and 18A coordinated over FM 1with their differing accounts of TFl 1.4a ~lolan of action. Going with the worst case 1scenario that TF「1 •偽 lhad changed plans and was assaulting south, made believable 1by the mini-g니n fire the base of fire element received, the flanking element halted and 1moved into position to provide covering fire while the base of fire moved east out of TF 11.4a |way.

This would 이ea「AIF for TF I 1.4a Iprior to their presumed 1assault south, and support the base of fire's move east.

While 1waiting on the third GBU-12, a lone HMMWV came within 100 m of the flanking element, 1moving north on the hardball road and eventually recovering a destroyed civilian SUV 1and leaving. With only small arms and one AT-4, the possibility of it being one of the AIF 1operated HMMWVs left the flanking element with the choice of bad or worse regarding 1which side of the berm to stay on. Following the third GBU-12 the flanking element 1moved south across the road, consolidated and accounted for all personnel, and 1unsuccessfully attempted an Apache gun run on the treeline 75 m north of the base of 1fire element before linking back up with them.

During this time, USSOF observed SAF and RPG fire at two AH-64 Apaches that\nwere circling approx. 2 kms to the NE. After approx. 30 minutes on the ground USSOF\nand SWAT began a Movement To Contact IVO the area identified by ODAh-4a| with the\nunderstanding that all CF had left the area and the majority of AIF were killed earlier by\nUSSOF and ISF.\nPHASE 3: (EXECUTION):\nMovement to Contact: 18Z cross-loaded 12 x SWAT onto the 5-ton before infilling\ndirectly east on the hardball road leading to a set of chicken coups at MGRS 38S MA\n38。54좌 Order of March was two SWAT trucks in the lead, the HMMWV, four SWAT\ntrucks, the 5-ton, then the remaining SWAT trucks. The JTAC established comms with\nthe Apaches as the ground force left ASR Miami. The ground force approached the\nchicken coup from the south and moved the HMMWV to the lead to enter the perimeter\nfence. SWAT and the HMMWV drove the inside perimeter to clear the area, giving\nvisibility of the north side where an approx, six foot high berm 300 meters away ran east-\nwest and another berm approx. 500 meters away ran north-south, boxing the area in to\nthe north and east. The area between the chicken coup and the berm was open flat\nterrain with no cover. The lead HMMWV led the ground force east towards a break in\nthe berm attempting to get out of a potential Engagement Area (EA). On approach the\nHMMWV gunner saw a suspicious lone HMMWV move so니th to north on a hardball road\napprox. 500 meters east, then multiple armed LNs, vehicles, and HMMWVs on the\nopposite side of the berm in defensive fighting positions. The break in the berm was\nactually a cliff manned by more armed LNs. I 」3 b 6 I realizing the potential to\nbecome quickly overwhelmed but not having enemy PID, fired the .50 cal into the berm\nto keep their heads down. The LNs held fire and hurriedly pointed to the north.\nRealizing that the gro니nd force was boxed-in if AIF occupied and fired from the opposite\nside of the berm, the 18A directed the ground force to occupy the berm on the north and\neast of the chicken coup. ((USSOF later learned that the AOB, witnessing this unfold\nthrough an ISR feed, saw approx. 100 AIF on the opposite side of the berm.))\nReact to Ambush (MGRS 380a Q： Simultaneously, but unbeknownst to the lead\nHMMWV, AIF dismounts on the opposite side of the north berm (approx. 100 m to the\nnorth) began to engage the ground force with SAF. The 18Z in the 5-ton yelled for the\nground force to flank west towards the north berm.

This placed the HMMWV with half of SWAT to the east, and\nhalf of SWAT and the 5-ton to the west. The AIF displaced north from the berm and\noccupied hasty fighting positions along the tree line approx. 50 - 75 m north of the berm\nand continued to engage the ground force. At this point the ground force effectively\nbecame split in half with the 5-ton and SWAT on the west pinned down by effective fire\nand the HMMWV and SWAT less than 100 m to the east under minimal fire and able to\nmaneuver and return fire from the berm. Every time USSOF or SWAT on the west\nraised a head above the berm, incoming rounds sent dirt flying. SWAT received one\nWIA during this time and ground evacuated him to an Iraqi hospital. The JTAC\nrequested the Apaches, who were focused on the gunfire in the village, move to the\nground force location to conduct RW g니n nuns on the AIF fighting positions. The 5-ton\ngunner was the only individual on the west flank able to continually provide effective\nsuppressive fire. The eastern flank identified a white Bongo and a blue Bongo with a\nheavy MG mounted in the bed, approx. 200 - 300 meters to the north behind another\nberm, to which the AIF were maneuvering. I b 3. b 6 lenaaaed the blue Bongo with\nfour 81 mm Carl G니stav (Carl G) rounds (2 x HE, 2 x HEDP), killing one and impacting\nthe blue Bongo, while the HMMWV gunner engaged multiple dismounted targets. The\n18A engaged multiple targets before directing SWAT to occupy the eastern berm and\nrear security to prevent an AIF flanking mane 니 ver. The 18A and I b 3, b 6 Ithen\nexamined the eastern flank of the AIF and noticed a north-south running berm that\npotentially provided cover for a dismounted force to flank the AIF. At this point, approx,\nfive minutes into the react to ambush, the JTAC reported that an Apache was shot down\nto the NW at MGRS 36|i冨53园(just east of ASR Miami) by ground fire. The second\nApache then focused on the downed Apace. Additional reports came in confirming that\nthere were, in fact, three IA 니MMWVs IVO a village to the NW that were st이en by the\nAIF. Not realizing the severity of the western flank's situation, the 18A directed a break\nin contact to move to the downed aircraft. The 18Z informed the 18A that this was not\nfeasible due to the heavy volume of fire they were receiving, and recommended a\nflanking maneuver. The 18A acknowledged and instructed the SWAT CDR to assemble\nmen for a dismounted assault with the 18A, JTAC, andl b 3 b 6 I The 18Z then\nrecommended that the flanking element only establish a base of fire as opposed to\nassaulting west, do to limited ability to shift SWAT's fires in support of a moving element.\nI b 3, b EI wisely recommended the HMMWV with gunner and driver move to support\nthe western flank, where it assisted the 5-ton gunner in providing continual suppressive\nfire for the western flank. The 18A requested additional support from the AOB to secure\nthe crash site. The 18A, incorrectly understanding from the JTAC that the two remaining\nfast-movers could be split between the 18Z and the 18A, req니ested that it happen to\nensure both elements could receive CAS. Only later did it become apparent that the\nmessage was not understood due to multiple aircraft talking in the JTAC's ears at the\ntime. Meanwhile on the western flank, the 18Z, I              b 3 b 6              I\n(曲⑶,(b)(知ade repeated unsuccessful attempts to get SWAT to gain fire superiority from\nthe berm. These USSOF continually gave commands and led by example, rising above\nthe berm to engage the enemy and lead SWAT in establishing fire s니periority. Except\nfor one brief period they were simply unwilling to remain above the berm to return fire.\nUSSOF noticed that most of the AIF were wearing black tops and bottoms with assault\nvests and magazine racks.

I b 3 b 6~1 realized the impact on SWAT\nif a USSOF Soldier was removed from the fight and fought to avoid collapse on several\noccasions.

I b 3 b 6 learried an AT-4 he took from the HMMWV before\nit joined the base of fire team on the west.\n\nCompany Attack: There was now a flanking element consisting of 50 SWAT dismounts\nled by I            b 6           lalona with the 18A, JT AC, I b 3, b 6 I and interpreter\n\nI b 6 I and a base of fire element led by the 18Z and remaining USSOF and SWAT\nin이tiding two SWAT Company CDRs. The 18乙 with two USSOF injured and hims이f\ncontrolling the base of fire, directedl b 3 b 6 I to focus on the truck FM and SATCOM\nto maintain comms with the flanking element and the AOB, ensuring crucial comms\nduring the maneuver.丨 b 3 b 6 Icontinued providing crew-served fire\nsupport whilel              b 3 b 6              Icontinued motivating SWAT to\nreturn fire. The flanking element moved south around the eastern berm then back north,\npassing numerous ISF hunkered down in the low ground and stopped at another east-\nwest running berm j니st forward of earlier one. At this point the flanking element noticed\na road running east-west just in front of the berm, on which were multiple IP and civilian\nSUVs that were riddled with SAF. The road on the east running north-south was across\napprox. 50 m of open ground and the intersection had several other destroyed vehicles.\nThis position provided better visibility of the eastern flank to which the element was\nmaneuvering. Again,I h 3 h 6 land the 18A assessed the feasibility of moving north.\nAIF to the NW, seeing movement through the break in the berm, began firing on the\nflanking element, decreasing the rate of fire on the base of fire element. The 18Z was\nnow able to get the base of fire to provide suppressive fire. By this time a second flight\nof Apaches was on station providing gun runs on AIF fighting positions IVO the two\nBongo trucks. Using the base of fire and gun runs to suppress the AIF, the flanking\nelement crossed the road and moved north along the berm approx. 100 m before being\npinned down by SAF from the north. The JTAC identified the friendly position with a\nsignal mirror and requested a GBU-12 approx. 100 meters to the north on the two Bongo\ntrucks. The 18A told the flanking element to assault the enemy position as soon as the\nbomb landed. After impact the flanking element assaulted the enemy position, climbing\nan approx, eight foot berm to see down into the corner of a 10 foot deep trench line that\nran west as far as the eye could see and north approx. 50 m until another berm blocked\nthe view. On the opposite side another berm approx. 20 feet high from the bottom of the\ntrench 이ccked all but the barrel of the Bongo mounted heavy MG. USSOF and SWAT,\nstill receiving fire, engaged the survivors in the trench. I （b）⑹ Iwhile leading SWAT to\nthe top of the berm and engaging the enemy, received a gunshot wound to the face\nrequiring I b 3 b 6 Ito assess and pack the wound with Kerlix. This severely\ndiss니aded SWAT from continuing to fire from the top of the berm. This was the first\nrealization by the ground force of the magnitude of AIF defensive preparations. During\nthis time the JTAC witnessed one AIF blow himself 니p approx. 150 m away in the trench.\n\nSEGREW/REE TO USA/ AUS”                           GAN 7 G曲〃；2。3 2 g 3。\n   De이assified by: MG Micha이 X.

Realizing that the CAS allocation hadn't worked as planned,\nthe 18A and JTAC began working to get them a CAS mission. The aircraft, unable to\ndirectly communicate with the 18Z, requested a grid as opposed to a distance and\ndirection from the VS-17 panel marking the 5-ton at their position. After relaying the\nTGT grid, aircraft stated it was the friendly position of the VS-17 panel and requested a\ndistance and direction from the VS-17 panel then delayed again to confirm that the 18Z\nhad eyes on the TGT. USSOF confirmed that the original TGT grid was correct, but\nnumerous grids passed in a short period of time created confusion for the pilots. At this\ntime the confusion of numerous aircraft requiring air control assistance forced the JTAC\nto assume air traffic controller duties to arrange the aircraft. While this new development\nset in, HMMWVs approached from the north along the road, firing mini-g니ns and .50 cal\ninto the berm just north of the flanking element. It was unclear at first whether they were\nfrien에y or the st이en HMMWVs. B이ieving they were f「ien에y but fearing fratricide, the\n18A moved to a position in the open and began waving both arms at the HMMWVs,\nwhich then pulled into position next to the dismounts to coordinate.
